# url-shortener
URL Shortener in Python - Assessment task

#### Disclaimer
This is a sample app intended to solve the URL-Shortener problem commonly used in developer interviews, and should not be used in a production environment due to its limitations on security and in the generator algorithm.



### Random string generator algorithm
The process follows the idea to be as simple as possible, in both, random generation and collision avoidance. Since the expected amount of URLs to be shortened are just a few, intended for testing purpose only, it does not follow any best approach or performance rules used in real production environments.

### Requirements
* Python3
* curl (for command line testing)

### Installation


### Execution
```shell

```

#### Create users
